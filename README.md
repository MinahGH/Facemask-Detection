# Facemask-Detection
In this work, we have used YOLO-V5 to detect face masks. We have also presented our efforts in collecting diverse images, in which people were wearing masks correctly
and incorrectly, multiple people in one image, and masks with no one wearing them.
A whole preprocessing pipeline was made to annotate and split our images for preparation in order to be fed to the model. Moreover, a lot of experiments were made to tune our
model and find the best parameters. We have also increased our model’s performance by using data augmentation by changing the brightness, adding noise, and blurring the
images. Also, error analysis on the experiments was performed and investigated to define the model’s weaknesses and define our next steps to be considered for future work.
